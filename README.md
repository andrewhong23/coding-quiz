## Description


Here I have created a short coding quiz for people who either want to practice or use for interview prep.  It is a timed 4 question quiz that will test the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.   


## Installation

This was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  Questions were generated by using a for loop for each question and answer pool.  If statments are used to determine if the answer was correct and how many points were given.  By using local storage, each point is saved and spit out at the end for a final score.  The same goes for the initails that are inputed at the end.  

## Usage

A student will answer the questions and recieve 1 point for each question that is answered correctly.  For every question that is answered wrong, students will get a 10 second penalty.  At the end of the quiz, a student can enter the initals and view their high scores.
